brim [-i|--input infile] [-o|--output outfile] <file...>

Interprets one or more brain* files in series.

If `--input` is unspecified, defaults to stdin; likewise, `--output` defaults 
to stdout.

If compiled in debug mode, or if feature `debug` was specified at compile time, 
adds the instruction ';'. This dumps out the current tape, pointer, and the
three(+) instructions around the current instruction.
